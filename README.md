# Tweeter Project
Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
4. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
5. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Purpose

The project allows users to tweet in real-time with AJAX without having to refresh the page as well as displaying the screen according to its responsive designs.

## Features

User can see previous tweets from the back-server.

## Final Product

Below is the desktopview for the app (screen max width of 767px).
